Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles 'Crazy in Love' and 'Baby Boy'.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Answered Correctly**: The model responded the correct answer. It may have also included other answers that were not in the context.\n",
    "2. ❎ **Skipped**: The model responded with \"I don't know\" (IDK) while the answer was present in the context. It's better than giving the wrong answer. It's better for the model say \"I don't know\" than giving the wrong answer. In our design, we know that a true answer exists and hence we're able to measure it -- this is not always the case. *This is a model error*. We exclude this from the overall error rate. \n",
